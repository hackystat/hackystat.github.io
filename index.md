Hackystat is an open source framework for collection, analysis, visualization, interpretation, annotation, and dissemination of software development process and product data. The Hackystat Framework supports three software development communities:

  * Researchers. Hackystat can be used to support empirical software engineering experimentation, metrics validation, and more long range research initiatives such as collective intelligence.

  * Practitioners. Hackystat can be used as infrastructure to support professional development, either proprietary or open source, by facilitating the collection and analysis of information useful for quality assurance, project planning, and resource management.

  * Educators. Hackystat is actively used in software engineering courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels to introduce students to software measurement and empirically guided software project management.

Hackystat users typically attach software 'sensors' to their development tools, which unobtrusively collect and send "raw" data about development to a web service called the Hackystat SensorBase for storage.

The SensorBase repository can be queried by other web services to form higher level abstractions of this raw data, and/or integrate it with other internet-based communication or coordination mechanisms, and/or generate visualizations of the raw data, abstractions, or annotations.

A long range goal of Hackystat is to facilitate "collective intelligence" in software development, by enabling collection, annotation, and diffusion of information and its subsequent analysis and abstraction into useful insight and knowledge. Hackystat services are designed to co-exist and complement other components in the "cloud" of internet information systems and services available for modern software development.

Hackystat is no longer under active development.
